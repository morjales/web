          <h2>Before You Play</h2>
          <p>Before you start to play, and sometimes before you even make your character, it's a good idea to think of a few things.
            <br>
            <br>What do you want to get out of the game?
            <br>Who is going to be the DM?
            <br>How hard do you want it to be?
          </p>

        <h3>Picking Your Playstyle</h3>
        <p>The first thing to know about Dungeons and Dragons is that the game is what you make of it.
          <br>The game can go from <a href="https://youtu.be/gv94UmHen9g?t=1m3s">dark and serious</a> to a <a href="https://youtu.be/gv94UmHen9g?t=6m38s">comedy</a>.
          <br>Depending on who you are playing with and how many times you've played, you might want to have different setups.
          <br>Some groups play because they can <a href="http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/4chan+tg+los+tiburon+the+epic+tale+of+los+tiburon_051ea4_3893794.jpg">decide to fight a dragon barehanded</a> while others just want <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wkZhp.png">a more relaxing game</a>
          <br>Choose what kind of experience you want before you set off on your adventure.
        </p>
        <h3>Choosing a DM</h3>
        <p>The DM, or Dungeon Master, is the environment, villains, shopkeepers, weather, and everything in between in your game.
          <br>Either you or one of your friends has to take up the difficult job of being the DM in order to play the game.
          <br>They are in charge of everything from choosing where your adventure leads, to how certain minor events play out.
          <br>You have to remember that when your character dies, they're not coming back, and a bad DM can take a well loved character down very quickly.
          <br><small>Which is why it's always a good idea to bribe them beforehand</small>.
          <br>Choose someone who has a knack for storytelling and doesn't have any personal vendettas against the players.
          <br>They can make your lives a <a href="https://youtu.be/gv94UmHen9g?t=2m59s">living hell</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/gv94UmHen9g?t=7m58s">shower you with gifts</a>
          <br>If you can't come up with a good plot, there are plenty of <a href="http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/adventure/">tools available</a> to make it easier.
          <br>In the end, though, it all comes down to what you <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/ei3CU">roll</a>.
